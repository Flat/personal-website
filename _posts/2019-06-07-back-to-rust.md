title: "Back to Rust"
---

Recently I have started working with Rust again, specifically re-writing my Discord bot to implement new language functions and updates in the library that it uses. [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) is the Discord library used by my bot [LupusreginaÎ²](https://github.com/Flat/Lupusregina-).
